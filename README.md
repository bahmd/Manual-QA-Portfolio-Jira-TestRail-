# JIRA + TestRail for Manual testing
I will use this repository to demonstrate how I use JIRA  and TestRail for manual testing.
This will include analysis, test case creation, test case execution, and bug report.

Please refer to the [Wiki section](https://github.com/bahmd/Testing-documentation-JIRA/wiki)
